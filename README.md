AS3 Leap
========

A base for creating pure actionscript apps using the Leap controller.

12 Feb 2013 - added Flare3D into the mix. Now you can move a 3D object with the Leap. Crazy.

30 Jan 2013 - Swapped out all of the leap code for the far superior work from https://github.com/logotype/LeapMotionAS3

29 Jan 2013 - Air framework up and running. Need to loop in Leap/Json parser.
